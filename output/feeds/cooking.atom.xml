&lt;p&gt;I wanted to see if I could use Chat GPT to become a better cook. I tried the Sous Chef GPT that Open AI produced themselves a while ago. I told it some things I had and the sort of dish I would like. It was a disaster. We did not even eat it. 
Lesson learned: don't just follow what they say blindly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next I decided to get better at making curries. This was not just about getting a recipe, but finding out about techniques. Firstly I asked about how I would generally get better at making curries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Becoming a better curry cook involves mastering techniques, understanding ingredients, and experimenting with flavors. Here are some ideas to help you improve your curry cooking skills:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn the Basics
Understand the Foundations: Study the essential components of curry, including spices, aromatics, and the balance of flavors.
Practice Knife Skills: Efficiently chopping onions, garlic, and ginger can significantly impact the texture and taste of your curry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experiment with Spices
Create Your Spice Blends: Try making garam masala, curry powder, and other spice blends from scratch.
Toast Spices: Toast whole spices before grinding them to enhance their flavor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Master Cooking Techniques
Browning Aromatics: Learn to brown onions, garlic, and ginger properly, as this forms the flavor base of many curries.
Layering Flavors: Add spices at different stages of cooking to develop depth in your curry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explore Different Cuisines
Regional Varieties: Explore curries from different regions, such as Indian, Thai, Japanese, and Caribbean.
Learn from Experts: Watch cooking shows, read cookbooks, and follow recipes from renowned chefs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus on Ingredients
Use Fresh Ingredients: Fresh herbs and high-quality spices can make a significant difference in your curry.
Experiment with Proteins: Try different proteins like chicken, lamb, beef, fish, tofu, and legumes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Practice Consistently
Cook Regularly: The more you cook, the more you'll understand the nuances of curry making.
Keep a Cooking Journal: Note what works and what doesn't, and adjust recipes based on your preferences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Balance Flavors
Taste as You Go: Continuously taste your curry and adjust the seasoning.
Balance Sweet, Sour, Salty, and Spicy: Ensure your curry has a harmonious balance of flavors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Refine Your Palate
Taste Different Curries: Try curries from various restaurants and compare their flavors and techniques.
Attend Tasting Events: Participate in food festivals or curry tasting events to expand your flavor profile.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use Quality Equipment
Invest in Good Pans: A heavy-bottomed pan can help distribute heat evenly.
Use a Spice Grinder: Freshly ground spices can greatly enhance the flavor of your curry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Incorporate Feedback
Cook for Others: Invite friends or family over and ask for honest feedback.
Join Cooking Communities: Participate in online forums, social media groups, or local cooking clubs to share experiences and get tips.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stay Inspired
Watch Cooking Shows: Programs like "MasterChef," "Chef’s Table," or shows focused on Indian cuisine can provide inspiration and techniques.
Follow Food Bloggers: Many food bloggers specialize in curries and offer step-by-step recipes and tips.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attend Workshops
Cooking Classes: Take part in cooking classes, either online or in-person, focusing on curry making.
Culinary Tours: Travel to regions known for their curries and take local cooking classes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand the Science
Learn Food Chemistry: Understanding how heat, fat, and acid interact with spices and other ingredients can help you create more flavorful curries.
Study Fermentation: Incorporate fermented ingredients like yogurt, kimchi, or pickles to add complexity to your curry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stay Organized
Mise en Place: Prepare all your ingredients before you start cooking to ensure a smooth cooking process.
Recipe Development: Experiment with creating your recipes once you’re comfortable with the basics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Health Considerations
Healthy Substitutes: Experiment with healthier ingredients like coconut milk instead of cream or ghee, and use more vegetables.
Control Spice Levels: Adjust the heat level to cater to different tastes and dietary restrictions.
By integrating these ideas into your cooking practice, you'll be able to develop your curry-making skills and create delicious, flavorful dishes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All useful advice. Next I started asking about specific recipes. I found asking for a recipe from a famous chef was a good idea. I don't know if these are really recipes from these chefs, but they are just a starting point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't like vegtable oil, so I ask for any ingredients that I don't want to be removed. If I think that a removal or substitution may impact the result I ask about that and am usually happy with the answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something else that the model is good at is changing spicy recipes to make them more child friendly. I wanted to make a Vindaloo recipe that I had made less spicy after the fact. I got great advice here on adding things like yogurt along with instructions on preventing it curdling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the final result:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ingredients:
For the Marinade:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 lbs (900g) boneless lamb shoulder, cut into 1.5-inch cubes
1 teaspoon ground turmeric
1 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons white wine vinegar
For the Spice Paste:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 tablespoons white wine vinegar
1 tablespoon ground cumin
1 tablespoon ground coriander
1 tablespoon paprika
1 teaspoon ground mustard seeds
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground cloves
1 teaspoon ground cardamom
6-8 dried red chilies, soaked in warm water for 20 minutes, then drained
4 cloves garlic, minced
1-inch piece of ginger, minced
For the Curry:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4 tablespoons coconut oil (or vegetable oil)
2 large onions, finely chopped
1 tablespoon tomato paste
1 cup water
Salt to taste
Fresh cilantro, chopped (for garnish)
Instructions:
Marinate the Lamb:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a large bowl, combine the lamb pieces with ground turmeric, salt, and white wine vinegar. Mix well, cover, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, preferably overnight.
Prepare the Spice Paste:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a blender or food processor, combine the white wine vinegar, ground cumin, ground coriander, paprika, ground mustard seeds, ground black pepper, ground cinnamon, ground cloves, ground cardamom, soaked red chilies, minced garlic, and minced ginger. Blend until you get a smooth paste.
Cook the Aromatics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heat the coconut oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pan over medium-high heat.
Add the finely chopped onions and sauté until they turn golden brown, about 10-12 minutes.
Cook the Spice Paste:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add the prepared spice paste to the pan. Cook, stirring frequently, for about 5 minutes until the paste thickens and the oil begins to separate.
Cook the Lamb:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add the marinated lamb pieces to the pan. Stir well to coat the lamb with the spice mixture. Cook for about 10 minutes until the lamb is browned on all sides.
Add Tomato Paste and Water:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stir in the tomato paste and cook for another 2-3 minutes.
Add the water and bring the mixture to a simmer.
Simmer the Curry:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reduce the heat to low, cover the pan, and let the curry simmer gently for about 1.5 to 2 hours, or until the lamb is tender. Stir occasionally and check the seasoning, adding salt to taste.
Serve:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Garnish with fresh chopped cilantro.
Serve hot with steamed rice, naan bread, or any Indian flatbread.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Cooking"></category></entry></feed>
