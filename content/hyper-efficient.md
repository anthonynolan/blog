## Hyperefficient

I am going to try some small experiments based on reading this book.

The first one will be based on the idea of structuring a work session. I am going to try this and see if it works better than the Pomodoro method. I often find Pomodoro hard to stick with if I am working on something boring and interrupting if I am doing something better. The 90 minute length of these sessions should help.

## Experiment detail

Try 2 of these 90 minute sessions this afternoon. Note how they go and decide whether or not to continue with this.
