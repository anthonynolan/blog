It was in the shape of 2 hemispheres with a central core of Berillium and Polonium - the initiator. The initiator's job was to produce some neutrons to start the nuclear chain reaction in the surrounding sphere of Pu. The Pu is sub critical as assembled, but the high explosive lenses surrounding it are used to squash it into a critical sphere along with getting the initiator to work.
Surrounding the Pu core is a thick layer of unrefined Uranium. This is very high density material - a forerunner of depleted Uranium? Natural Uranium has about 0.7% of the fissile isotope. Depleted uranium has less. It is a very dense material - about 70% more dense than lead. Used in weapons, radioactive material transport. 
Outside the unrefined uranium is an aluminium shell called the tamper. It along with the Uranium shell are there to prevent a large drop of pressure behind the explosive lenses. I think this is to make the action of the explosion on the core more predictable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The explosive lenses are in the shape of a football - &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truncated_icosahedron"&gt;a truncated icosahedron&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first live test was called Trinity. It took place at the Almogordo test range about 200 miles away from Los Alomos. The area was flat and so could be viewed from a great distance. The trigger was pulled from 10,000 yards away. Viewers - scientists and others - were positioned about 20 miles away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blast fused the sand in the area into glass called Trinitite. This was worn as jewelery soon after and could cause skin burns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thermonuclear bomb was called the Super. A patent for this was first produced by Von Neumann and Fuchs. Fuchs was a Soviet spy and gave all the secrets to the Russians. This inspired them to start their own full scale thermonuclear weapons programme. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teller designed the first successful thermonuclear bomb. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Russians Detonated the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsar_Bomba"&gt;Tsar Bomba&lt;/a&gt; in the Siberian Arctic. The TNT equivalent of this bomb has a volume of a cube of dynamite with a &lt;a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/6974bc20-ea02-463d-a128-111a7a25c685"&gt;310 metre side&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Notes"></category></entry><entry><title>Vienna - How the city of ideas created the modern world by Richard Cockett</title><link href="https://blog.cathalanddad.com/vienna-how-the-city-of-ideas-created-the-modern-world-by-richard-cockett.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-07-24T15:51:00+01:00</published><updated>2024-07-24T15:51:00+01:00</updated><author><name></name></author><id>tag:blog.cathalanddad.com,2024-07-24:/vienna-how-the-city-of-ideas-created-the-modern-world-by-richard-cockett.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Freedom of movement in the empire&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Emperor of Austria-Hungary insisted on freedom of movement of people within the Empire. This allowed large numbers of people to move from the east of the country to the city of Vienna and its suburbs. This is a simple case of allowing people to move from places of low productivity to places of high. I wonder what the impact was the places that experienced this talent drain?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bildung&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the culture of self improvement over amassing money and property. The Vienniese had strong focus on the value of education and learning. The extended to science, the arts and many other ares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ringstrasse and the surrounding wealthy areas had may amatuer scientists and zoologists. Large numbers of animals and plants kept in apartments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;City of Music. Mahler, Schoenberg and Alban Berg.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Art and literature. Gustav Klimt, Egon Schiele and Kolomon Moser.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Psychoanalysis. Freud.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Philosophy. Popper, Wittgenstein.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Physics. Schrödinger.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Architecture. Adolf Loos.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Red Vienna&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the socialist and communist leanings of many in Vienna - reflecting much of Europe's interest in Communism in the inter war years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Black Vienna&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Populist groups in opposition to the socialists of Red Vienna. The nurturing ground for Hitler. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Anchluss&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nazis Annexed Austria in 1938, an event known as the Anschluss, and began the persecution and purging of jews. This marked the end of the open, enlightened Viennese. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Influence in America&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vinnese emígrés were a big influence in America - in Architecture and the arts as well as being founders of the ideas of consumer science. The focus group is essentially one of their inventions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Influence in the UK&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viennese émigrés also had notable influence in the UK, particularly in fields such as architecture, music, and psychoanalysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Austrian School&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Austrian School of Economics is a libertarian school advocating for small government and private property.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Notes"></category></entry><entry><title>Daddy is a Doctor</title><link href="https://blog.cathalanddad.com/daddy-is-a-doctor.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-07-23T10:22:00+01:00</published><updated>2024-07-23T10:22:00+01:00</updated><author><name></name></author><id>tag:blog.cathalanddad.com,2024-07-23:/daddy-is-a-doctor.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is an idea from Daniel Dennett's book Intuition pumps and other tools for thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea here is that a little kid could say something like the above and not really know what this meant. This does not mean they are lying, but their concept of what a doctor is (or even a daddy) is not well formed. As they grow up and find out more about life they will have a greater understanding of what those words mean, but initially it is quite an isolated belief for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think an interesting thing about this idea is that beliefs have a support structure or set of connections around them. Some may start like this - quite isolated, but connected over time. While other beliefs may be tethered to some of our existing beliefs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a useful idea to keep in mind when learning new concepts. I have often found getting things that I have studied into my everyday life to be very difficult. Courses which I had done well in (Natural Language Processing on Coursera for example) are very difficult to fit into real use. In the case of the NLP course I worked through all of the code notebooks again with as little reference to the supporting material as possible - make my mind dig for the ideas. Although I found this very useful it is a time consuming approach. And even with this double time commitment I am still not sure that I could reproduce all of the results in this course. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe this is an argument to learn less, but learn it better. 'Internalise' is a word that used to be in more frequent usage about concepts learned in work. I think that idea is very important. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the Industrial Revolution in Britian people became obsessed with 'useful knowledge'. There were Encyclopedias and Almanacs and garden shed inventors trying to get things to work in the world. We would probably be a lot better off if we paid more attention to how we are going to use the things we learn.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Notes"></category></entry></feed>
