&lt;p&gt;I want to improve my overall level of fitness. VO2 max seems to be a reasonable way to measure this. A proxy for VO2max is a fitness test over a specific length of course. For example running a mile. For the test to be useful it needs to be repeatable and give consistent results over short periods of time. After an initial few attempts the typical time on the test needs to settle down to be reasonably repeatable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am cycling from my house in Glasnevin to Sutton and back as my test route. I have been repeating this route mainly for training rather than testing for quite some time now, but have only been serious about improving my times since about 4 months ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reasons&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have never been a competitive athlete, but decided to see if I could improve my fitness more systematically than I normally do. I found that when I attempted the test/training route my times settled out at about 1 hr 8 mins with some variation. In particular I noticed that on the days that I did this cycle (or a longer route) I was very low on energy for a good part of the rest of the day. I typically cycle in the morning at the weekends. I am curious to see if I can reduce this level of energy depletion as I get fitter. In other words will I be able to do a hard workout of a reasonable length and intensity and not be as tired over the course of the rest of the day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do this I need to get fitter - fitness of this sort is really the ability of my cells to respire. Better aerobic fitness is less about heart and lung fitness than about my bodies ability to make use of all of that oxygen and fuel. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A list of resources and practices to get python beyond the basics&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The book&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am using &lt;a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/fluent-python-2nd/9781492056348/"&gt;Fluent Python&lt;/a&gt; by Luciano Romalho as the starting point.

&lt;p&gt;A list of resources and practices to get python beyond the basics&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The book&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am using &lt;a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/fluent-python-2nd/9781492056348/"&gt;Fluent Python&lt;/a&gt; by Luciano Romalho as the starting point. I bought this book years ago and never really got the best value from it. I skipped too much of it. Now on a revisit some sections are no longer as up to date as I would like, but mostly it is still excellent. There is a second edition (linked) which I am sure brings it up to date. If python is a key skill you should buy a paper copy of this book. It is well worth the money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My process is to take a chapter at a time and read it in depth - this can take a few hours for the more substantial chapters which in this book is most of them. 
I have a python repl at the ready to try out some of the examples. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(The new &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.13.html#whatsnew313-better-interactive-interpreter"&gt;3.13 repl&lt;/a&gt; is great. Simple things like multiline editing that works and colour output are a big step up from the seriously outdated prior versions)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Commit to memory&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I try to extract anything that I need to remember with &lt;a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/"&gt;Anki&lt;/a&gt;. This is a bit of a chore at first, but after a while you notice yourself remembering many more significant things. Working in technology there is a lot to take in and a lot of confusion can creep into your work if you don't make this part of your practice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Practice with an AI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This kind of interlaces with the reading and memorising sections. I keep a single thread &lt;a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/6738b604-2374-8013-bd34-734e7df6593a"&gt;conversation&lt;/a&gt; in Chat gpt and tell it what section I am interested in practicing. It usually gives me 'starter code' - the answer - even though I tell it I am trying to learn, but that is no harm as I just ignore that until I have given my stuff a go. I find this a very effective way to learn as I can ask questions for clarificaiton, but am not looking for the bulk of the material to come from the ai. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I progress with this I will share photos of the contents pages of the book with the model to see what else it can come up with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far I have been at this for a couple of weeks - in my spare time with a good bit extra at the weekends. A mixture of glad that I am learning this important skill at last and disappointment that I have let this lie for so long without skilling up properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Regular practices to keep up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of useful information in the python docs. From the whats new sections to the PEPs (both new ones and older ones). The bar is high in these docs, so they are an opportunity not to be missed. There is so much here that it is almost always time well spent.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Software"></category></entry><entry><title>Notes on The Man from the Future - fission</title><link href="https://blog.cathalanddad.com/notes-on-the-man-from-the-future-fission.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-07-30T09:39:00+01:00</published><updated>2024-07-30T09:39:00+01:00</updated><author><name></name></author><id>tag:blog.cathalanddad.com,2024-07-30:/notes-on-the-man-from-the-future-fission.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The fissile material was Plutonium.

It was in the shape of 2 hemispheres with a central core of Berillium and Polonium - the initiator. The initiator's job was to produce some neutrons to start the nuclear chain reaction in the surrounding sphere of Pu. The Pu is sub critical as assembled, but the high explosive lenses surrounding it are used to squash it into a critical sphere along with getting the initiator to work.
Surrounding the Pu core is a thick layer of unrefined Uranium. This is very high density material - a forerunner of depleted Uranium? Natural Uranium has about 0.7% of the fissile isotope. Depleted uranium has less. It is a very dense material - about 70% more dense than lead. Used in weapons, radioactive material transport. 
Outside the unrefined uranium is an aluminium shell called the tamper. It along with the Uranium shell are there to prevent a large drop of pressure behind the explosive lenses. I think this is to make the action of the explosion on the core more predictable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The explosive lenses are in the shape of a football - &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truncated_icosahedron"&gt;a truncated icosahedron&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first live test was called Trinity. It took place at the Almogordo test range about 200 miles away from Los Alomos. The area was flat and so could be viewed from a great distance. The trigger was pulled from 10,000 yards away. Viewers - scientists and others - were positioned about 20 miles away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blast fused the sand in the area into glass called Trinitite. This was worn as jewelery soon after and could cause skin burns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thermonuclear bomb was called the Super. A patent for this was first produced by Von Neumann and Fuchs. Fuchs was a Soviet spy and gave all the secrets to the Russians. This inspired them to start their own full scale thermonuclear weapons programme. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teller designed the first successful thermonuclear bomb. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Russians Detonated the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsar_Bomba"&gt;Tsar Bomba&lt;/a&gt; in the Siberian Arctic.

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to see if I could use Chat GPT to become a better cook. I tried the Sous Chef GPT that Open AI produced themselves a while ago. I told it some things I had and the sort of dish I would like. It was a disaster. We did not even eat it. 
Lesson learned: don't just follow what they say blindly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next I decided to get better at making curries. This was not just about getting a recipe, but finding out about techniques. Firstly I asked about how I would generally get better at making curries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Becoming a better curry cook involves mastering techniques, understanding ingredients, and experimenting with flavors. Here are some ideas to help you improve your curry cooking skills:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn the Basics
Understand the Foundations: Study the essential components of curry, including spices, aromatics, and the balance of flavors.
Practice Knife Skills: Efficiently chopping onions, garlic, and ginger can significantly impact the texture and taste of your curry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experiment with Spices
Create Your Spice Blends: Try making garam masala, curry powder, and other spice blends from scratch.
Toast Spices: Toast whole spices before grinding them to enhance their flavor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Master Cooking Techniques
Browning Aromatics: Learn to brown onions, garlic, and ginger properly, as this forms the flavor base of many curries.
Layering Flavors: Add spices at different stages of cooking to develop depth in your curry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explore Different Cuisines
Regional Varieties: Explore curries from different regions, such as Indian, Thai, Japanese, and Caribbean.
Learn from Experts: Watch cooking shows, read cookbooks, and follow recipes from renowned chefs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus on Ingredients
Use Fresh Ingredients: Fresh herbs and high-quality spices can make a significant difference in your curry.
Experiment with Proteins: Try different proteins like chicken, lamb, beef, fish, tofu, and legumes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Practice Consistently
Cook Regularly: The more you cook, the more you'll understand the nuances of curry making.
Keep a Cooking Journal: Note what works and what doesn't, and adjust recipes based on your preferences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Balance Flavors
Taste as You Go: Continuously taste your curry and adjust the seasoning.
Balance Sweet, Sour, Salty, and Spicy: Ensure your curry has a harmonious balance of flavors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Refine Your Palate
Taste Different Curries: Try curries from various restaurants and compare their flavors and techniques.
Attend Tasting Events: Participate in food festivals or curry tasting events to expand your flavor profile.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use Quality Equipment
Invest in Good Pans: A heavy-bottomed pan can help distribute heat evenly.
Use a Spice Grinder: Freshly ground spices can greatly enhance the flavor of your curry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Incorporate Feedback
Cook for Others: Invite friends or family over and ask for honest feedback.
Join Cooking Communities: Participate in online forums, social media groups, or local cooking clubs to share experiences and get tips.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stay Inspired
Watch Cooking Shows: Programs like "MasterChef," "Chef’s Table," or shows focused on Indian cuisine can provide inspiration and techniques.
Follow Food Bloggers: Many food bloggers specialize in curries and offer step-by-step recipes and tips.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attend Workshops
Cooking Classes: Take part in cooking classes, either online or in-person, focusing on curry making.
Culinary Tours: Travel to regions known for their curries and take local cooking classes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand the Science
Learn Food Chemistry: Understanding how heat, fat, and acid interact with spices and other ingredients can help you create more flavorful curries.
Study Fermentation: Incorporate fermented ingredients like yogurt, kimchi, or pickles to add complexity to your curry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stay Organized
Mise en Place: Prepare all your ingredients before you start cooking to ensure a smooth cooking process.
Recipe Development: Experiment with creating your recipes once you’re comfortable with the basics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Health Considerations
Healthy Substitutes: Experiment with healthier ingredients like coconut milk instead of cream or ghee, and use more vegetables.
Control Spice Levels: Adjust the heat level to cater to different tastes and dietary restrictions.
By integrating these ideas into your cooking practice, you'll be able to develop your curry-making skills and create delicious, flavorful dishes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All useful advice. Next I started asking about specific recipes. I found asking for a recipe from a famous chef was a good idea. I don't know if these are really recipes from these chefs, but they are just a starting point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't like vegtable oil, so I ask for any ingredients that I don't want to be removed. If I think that a removal or substitution may impact the result I ask about that and am usually happy with the answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something else that the model is good at is changing spicy recipes to make them more child friendly. I wanted to make a Vindaloo recipe that I had made less spicy after the fact. I got great advice here on adding things like yogurt along with instructions on preventing it curdling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the final result:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ingredients:
For the Marinade:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 lbs (900g) boneless lamb shoulder, cut into 1.5-inch cubes
1 teaspoon ground turmeric
1 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons white wine vinegar
For the Spice Paste:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 tablespoons white wine vinegar
1 tablespoon ground cumin
1 tablespoon ground coriander
1 tablespoon paprika
1 teaspoon ground mustard seeds
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground cloves
1 teaspoon ground cardamom
6-8 dried red chilies, soaked in warm water for 20 minutes, then drained
4 cloves garlic, minced
1-inch piece of ginger, minced
For the Curry:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4 tablespoons coconut oil (or vegetable oil)
2 large onions, finely chopped
1 tablespoon tomato paste
1 cup water
Salt to taste
Fresh cilantro, chopped (for garnish)
Instructions:
Marinate the Lamb:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a large bowl, combine the lamb pieces with ground turmeric, salt, and white wine vinegar. Mix well, cover, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, preferably overnight.
Prepare the Spice Paste:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a blender or food processor, combine the white wine vinegar, ground cumin, ground coriander, paprika, ground mustard seeds, ground black pepper, ground cinnamon, ground cloves, ground cardamom, soaked red chilies, minced garlic, and minced ginger. Blend until you get a smooth paste.
Cook the Aromatics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heat the coconut oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pan over medium-high heat.
Add the finely chopped onions and sauté until they turn golden brown, about 10-12 minutes.
Cook the Spice Paste:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add the prepared spice paste to the pan. Cook, stirring frequently, for about 5 minutes until the paste thickens and the oil begins to separate.
Cook the Lamb:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add the marinated lamb pieces to the pan. Stir well to coat the lamb with the spice mixture. Cook for about 10 minutes until the lamb is browned on all sides.
Add Tomato Paste and Water:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stir in the tomato paste and cook for another 2-3 minutes.
Add the water and bring the mixture to a simmer.
Simmer the Curry:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reduce the heat to low, cover the pan, and let the curry simmer gently for about 1.5 to 2 hours, or until the lamb is tender. Stir occasionally and check the seasoning, adding salt to taste.
Serve:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Garnish with fresh chopped cilantro.
Serve hot with steamed rice, naan bread, or any Indian flatbread.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Cooking"></category></entry><entry><title>Vienna - How the city of ideas created the modern world by Richard Cockett</title><link href="https://blog.cathalanddad.com/vienna-how-the-city-of-ideas-created-the-modern-world-by-richard-cockett.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-07-24T15:51:00+01:00</published><updated>2024-07-24T15:51:00+01:00</updated><author><name></name></author><id>tag:blog.cathalanddad.com,2024-07-24:/vienna-how-the-city-of-ideas-created-the-modern-world-by-richard-cockett.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Freedom of movement in the empire&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Emperor of Austria-Hungary insisted on freedom of movement of people within the Empire. This allowed large numbers of people to move from the east of the country to the city of Vienna and its suburbs. This is a simple case of allowing people to move from places of low productivity to places of high. I wonder what the impact was the places that experienced this talent drain?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bildung&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the culture of self improvement over amassing money and property. The Vienniese had strong focus on the value of education and learning. The extended to science, the arts and many other ares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ringstrasse and the surrounding wealthy areas had may amatuer scientists and zoologists. Large numbers of animals and plants kept in apartments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;City of Music. Mahler, Schoenberg and Alban Berg.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Art and literature. Gustav Klimt, Egon Schiele and Kolomon Moser.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Psychoanalysis. Freud.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Philosophy. Popper, Wittgenstein.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Physics. Schrödinger.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Architecture. Adolf Loos.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Red Vienna&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the socialist and communist leanings of many in Vienna - reflecting much of Europe's interest in Communism in the inter war years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Black Vienna&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Populist groups in opposition to the socialists of Red Vienna. The nurturing ground for Hitler. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Anchluss&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nazis Annexed Austria in 1938, an event known as the Anschluss, and began the persecution and purging of jews. This marked the end of the open, enlightened Viennese. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Influence in America&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vinnese emígrés were a big influence in America - in Architecture and the arts as well as being founders of the ideas of consumer science. The focus group is essentially one of their inventions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Influence in the UK&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea here is that a little kid could say something like the above and not really know what this meant. This does not mean they are lying, but their concept of what a doctor is (or even a daddy) is not well formed. As they grow up and find out more about life they will have a greater understanding of what those words mean, but initially it is quite an isolated belief for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think an interesting thing about this idea is that beliefs have a support structure or set of connections around them. Some may start like this - quite isolated, but connected over time. While other beliefs may be tethered to some of our existing beliefs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a useful idea to keep in mind when learning new concepts. I have often found getting things that I have studied into my everyday life to be very difficult. Courses which I had done well in (Natural Language Processing on Coursera for example) are very difficult to fit into real use. In the case of the NLP course I worked through all of the code notebooks again with as little reference to the supporting material as possible - make my mind dig for the ideas. Although I found this very useful it is a time consuming approach. And even with this double time commitment I am still not sure that I could reproduce all of the results in this course. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe this is an argument to learn less, but learn it better. 'Internalise' is a word that used to be in more frequent usage about concepts learned in work. I think that idea is very important. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the Industrial Revolution in Britian people became obsessed with 'useful knowledge'. There were Encyclopedias and Almanacs and garden shed inventors trying to get things to work in the world. We would probably be a lot better off if we paid more attention to how we are going to use the things we learn.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Notes"></category></entry></feed>
