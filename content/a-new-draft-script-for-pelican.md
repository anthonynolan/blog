To make it easier to draft a blog entry for Pelican I got chat gpt to create a bash [script](https://github.com/anthonynolan/blog/blob/master/create_draft.sh) for me. It is very simple, but with a few minor mods it does exactly what I wanted and saved me maybe 20 minutes getting it right. This does mean that I will probably start to forget what little bash I already know, but that may not matter for much longer.
