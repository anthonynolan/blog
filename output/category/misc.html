<h1>Idea</h1>
<p>I have a video of an Irish Dancer taken from a stationary camera. I would like to create a version of this video which is more closely cropped to the dancer so she can be seen more clearly. </p>
<p>I did something like this for a project I did recently to track a dumbbell in an image. I took the approach of playing the video in a browser and showing an overlay of a red bounding box. The box was movable as the video played and the coordinates of the box were written to the console as the video played and the box moved. </p>
<p>This approach gave quite a jerky movement of the box. This may have been something related to how the playback worked in the browser, or more likely how the coordinates were written to the console. I an effort to do better on an idea like this I wanted to try some automatic annotation tools.</p>
<h1>CVAT</h1>
<p>This is an opersource fairly high end tool for annotating video. I uploaded my video and manually created a bounding box. The process of interpolating this or tracking with AI is not straightforward. I can either learn more about this approach - which may pay dividends in the future for other projects - or can revert to the browser method and see if I can improve that. </p>
<p>The dancer does not move in a nice linear fashion like the pool balls in the videos from CVAT on youtube, but interpolation may be the best way to go. Quite a steep learning curve for these tools but that is to be expected. Labeling video is not an easy task and there are a lot of options.</p>
